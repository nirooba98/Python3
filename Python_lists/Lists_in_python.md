                                                       Lists in Python
                                                            


A list is a built-in data structure in python. You can store multiple values of the same data type inside a single variable using lists.


                                        fruit = [“Apple”, “Pineapple”, “Orange”, “Strawberry”]	


The elements in the list must be contained within square brackets. 

                                                      List Index in Python
                                                          
                                                          

                                        fruit = [“Apple”, “Pineapple”, “Orange”, “Strawberry”]	
                                                    |          |          |           |
                                                    0          1          2           3
                                             

The index value starts with a ‘zero’ in python lists. Index values are helpful when we want to access a specific element or a value in a list. 
We can also access a list element using a negative index.



                                        fruit = [“Apple”, “Pineapple”, “Orange”, “Strawberry”]	
                                                    |           |          |           |
                                                   -4          -3         -2          -1
                                                   

A negative index can be used to read or access an element from the end of a list. The last element of any list starts with an index of -1 and so on.
 
We can perform multiple functions on lists in python such as modifying the value of an element, adding a new value to the list, 
removing an element from the list and much more. There are a lot of list methods available in python that you can explore on the internet.

                                                                Tuples in Python


Tuples are also a built-in data structure in python. You can store multiple values inside a tuple.


                                                    new_tuple = (12, “name”, True, “Python”)	
                                                    

A tuple is created using round brackets which contain values of different data types. 



                                                    new_tuple = (12, “name”, True, “Python”)
                                                                  |     |      |       |
                                                                  0     1      2       3
                                                                  
	
			     
The index value starts with a ‘zero’ in tuples as well. We can also access a tuple with a negative index starting from the end.



                                                    new_tuple = (12, “name”, True, “Python”)
                                                                  |     |      |       |
                                                                 -4    -3     -2      -1
                                                                 

 
We cannot modify a tuple once it is created. Tuples are ordered and unchangeable.
Although we can still perform multiple functions on tuples in python.

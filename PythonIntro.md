How to Install Python in your system?

There are two versions of Python 

                                 - Python 2 (Not supported anymore. Available as default version in MacOS)
                                 
                                 - Python 3 (Latest version. Recommended to most of the users.)
                                 
		                                                                
Python 3 is the latest version of the language that is recommended for beginners and most of the users. Python 2 is not updated anymore except for security updates.

You can download and install Python3 in your OS from their official website. Download Python here. https://www.python.org/downloads/

Editor for Python.


You can write and run simple python programmes from your terminal or command prompt itself. For example,

- Open your Terminal and type “python3” .
- You will be then able to run a few basic programmes in your terminal itself.
- For example, try 
                 
                 print("Hello World")
                 
  and run it in your terminal. 
  


To run python programmes more efficiently, you may need an editor designed just for running python codes. ‘PyCharm’ is a commonly recommended editor for python. 

You can install PyCharm here. https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

You can install PyCharm for free for both intel processors and Apple silicon.

Once Installed, you are ready to develop your first Python project!
